            <h1>Albert Einstein <span>E = mc² By Faraz Gul</span></h1>
            <p>Einstein’s parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein,<br>
                was originally a featherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with<br>
                moderate success. His mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran the family household.<br>
                He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born two years after Albert
                <br><br>
                Albert Einstein is best known for his equation E = mc2, which states that energy<br>
                and mass (matter) are the same thing, just in different forms. He is also known<br> 
                for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, for which he won the Nobel Prize<br>
                for Physics in 1921
                <br><br>

                During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time, he produced much of his<br>
                remarkable work and in 1908 he was appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became<br>
                Professor Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical Physics at Prague,<br>
                returning to Zurich in the following year to fill a similar post.<br>
                <br>
                In 1914 he was appointed Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor<br>
                in the University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and remained in Berlin<br>
                until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to<br>
                America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*.<br>
                He became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.<br>
